- are all the pieces in place to let you live your life in the medium of Irish through the computer?
- Irish is relatively well represented on the internet compared to other minority languages 
- email groups, message boards before the advent of social media
- used to be the standard before Unicode to represent the fada (á í ó é ú) to use / for example ca/d e/ ma/r a/ta tu/
- Impossible to search 
- CommonCrawl - 10% of Irish text is spam, Google translated or generated by LLMs made by people who don't speak the language, poisons the data used for training the LLMs
- Small language community - don't have the same amount of data as English - we need to find/make better training data
- Machine translated content - native speaker would spot it straight away 
- Feel the English within it from the syntax 
- Gaeilge briste/ Bearlachas
- Recycling that happens - a negative pattern 
- The domains that gets published in Irish is restricted - not much hard sciences etc 
- What is happening to the Irish language - slop infestation - machine translated poor quality Irish is poisoning the learning data - the good organic content isn't plentiful
- LLMs perform notably worse with minority languages 
- most languages of the world are not served very well with this LLM technology 
- We saw slop infestation before LLMs with Google Translate/machine translated 
- no cross checking
- never machine translate into a language you do not speak 
- Irish - lot of second language speaker and enthusiastic learners who publish stuff online - but their Irish may not be as fluent or up to scratch - also poisons the learning data
- Irish Wikipedia - a lot of people who contributed did not have good Irish but this has changed to people who have good Irish in recent years 
	- For years it was written in poor Irish - had poor rep for fluent speakers for years - becoming a really good resource for schools 
	- Resources like the Irish WIki are very important 
- We need newer approaches that allows smaller languages to have good training data despite the lesser resources available 
- Do more than just scrape with LLMs - have to remember there is a sort of optimisation in research for data in English 
- pressure for technological solutions that work well for English since that's where the money is but would not work well for smaller languages such as Irish
- A lot of the solutions that were built for English wouldn't work for analysing Irish 
- we have a lot of initial mutations in Irish that we don't have in English
- Lemma only versions of corpus (dictionary)
- Big linguistics for small data
- Language technology that everyone wants to use that works well for majority languages but doesn't for minority languages - digital exclusions - disrespect for the language
- Not relevant in the digital world - creates a negative feedback loop
- Irish language versions of social media websites. Irish versions of OSes etc 
- localisation for OSS 
- Prevent the diminishing of the Irish language 
- Better place than most European lesser spoken language
- Again we are beginning to worry about digital exclusion because LLMs do not support Irish or other minority languages as well
- 2000 - wanted a fully localisated Irish desktop - translated Linux/Firefox
- Technology moves fast - a lot of Irish speakers want to use Chrome - we must go where our users are 
- Permission from Google to translate Chrome - lucked out 10 years ago 
- Translate gmail into Irish - unpaid 
- Since the year 2000 - translated a lot of software into Irish - volunteer effort and people willing to invest to avoid the digital exclusion 
- Stabilisation of the technology - space for volunteers 
- AI point of view - how big can we make it
- Waiting for that time where it's a bit more efficient/bit more local 
- Effort in the indigenous/minority language community to build their own software - digital sovereignty - should not be shared with big for profit companies that do not usually care about these languages - possibly do harm to those communities
- Google translate has done more harm than good for the Irish language 
- We can do the effort at home with Irish speakers at mind and have their best interests at heart 
- Irish language orgs are interested in AI for servicing the Gaeltacht 
- Údarás na Gaeltacht has a digital plan in mind to allow this AI dev to happen in Ireland 
- focloir.ie - speech recognition 
- This is the sort of model that we should pursue
- Grant money flowing 
- Research labs in Ireland that focus on Irish and have the resources available to do a good job 
- Dialects of Irish - risks that AI tools could standardise or simplify Irish or if it could stigmatise dialect usage?
	- we need enough high quality data 
	- Don't have much faith in the tech working yet
	- The tech that will serve the Irish language wouldn't serve the dialects yet 
	- publishing books etc 
	- Google translate is trained primarily on legislation which is translated in standard Irish which is stilted and legalese 
	- starting to leak into the language
	- standardising the language especially to non native speakers/learners 
	- need to handle the situation and need to be smart about it 
	- more obvious in the spoken language 
		- differences are noticeable 
		- we need to do speech synthesis 3 or 4 times - so that a Ulster Irish speaker doesn't need to listen to a Connacht Irish speaker
		- TV media has tried to fix the problem by having one output with many dialects together 
		- less and less of an issue 
	- rules how to filter out the slop for training data in the Irish langauge?
		- it gets harder and harder
		- the models are trained to spot authentic Irish
		- as the models get better it's harder to spot mistakes
		- the top level domain of the url is the strongest signal you'll find 
		- curated the data set in a top down way
		- know which domains contain real authentic Irish 
		- birds eye view of the entire dataset
		- dangerous to collect everything and try to detect the slop
		- avoid using the legislation and Irish Wikipedia
		- use news media 
		- Gaois - initiative within DCU - add lists on to expand the vocab 
		- mind your metadata - awful lot of people like us that volunteer their time - find someone who could help you look through the metadata and vet certain sources - reach out and ask 
	- how can we pull this strategy into the Irish education system?
		- AI safety - nowhere near ready for the school system
		- Could (once it has been made more safe) be made into a tutor 
		- A lot of technologies are an add on to language as it is human 
		- not in isolation 
	- Missing words in Irish - inventing new words - AI would complicate/hallucinate new words - how to spot?
